A basic *Rock Paper Scissors* game made with Python.

## Features

* I use a LEFT function in order to take the first letter of the users input. Provided the input starts with "R", "P" or "S" it will be valid.
* I added handling for misinputs in the case that the user inputs something other than a word/letter starting with "R", "P" or "S". Try using "Banana" as an input.
* I added a loop so the game can be replayed, with values resetting so that the game doesn't get caught in an infinite loop. I saw that this was missing on most solutions out there, and besides, who doesn't play *Rock Paper Scissors* for a best of 3? 😏
